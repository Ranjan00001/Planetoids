# Planetoids Game

This project is an object-oriented game called *Planetoids*, similar to the classic *Asteroids* game. The game involves navigating a ship, avoiding obstacles, and completing various waves. The primary controller of the game is the `Planetoids` class, which manages game states such as loading, active gameplay, and game over. The core gameplay functionality is handled by the `Wave` class, which includes updating and rendering game elements.
